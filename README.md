# Text World Game
A simple short text-based RPG game that I made in AP Computer Science! Everything is played through the terminal.

## How to play
1. Clone the repo by running `git clone https://github.com/youngbryanyu/TextWorldGame` in the desired parent directory. 
2. Navigate to the `/src` directory.
3. Run `javac Main.java` to compile the java file, then run `java Main` to run the game!
